# SAT+

This is a Haskell library for constraint programming using a SAT-solver,
in particular MiniSAT.

Original repository is at [github.com/koengit/satplus](https://github.com/koengit/satplus).
This is a fork by [Inari](https://github.com/inariksit), with the only change of adding the module SAT.Named. 
It contains versions of the functions where you can give names to the variables. Otherwise they are just called v569 and so on.

See documentation in [the original](https://github.com/koengit/satplus).
